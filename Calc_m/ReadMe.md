### This file is about how to calculate the subsidy/taxation/penalty and how to generate the figures.

*************************************************
- There are several stages:
1. The first is that the machine number n=4 and numerical values in matrix are written by me.

The files include

    - *machine_number.m* (Judge the number of machines)
    - *C1.m*
    - *Sub_Pel_e2.m* *iteration_e2.m*
    - *Sub_Pel_e2_2.m* (Calculate ... for Example2)
    - *Penalty_e1.m* *Penalty_e2.m* *Taxation_e2z.m*
    - *Subsidy_e1.m* *z5.m* ...
```
1 is S and P example.
2 is my example.(S and T)

-- *figure1.m* (Used for C1.m)
-- *figure2.m*(Used for testing. Machine_number.m)

```

2. The second is that the matrix is generated by the program itself, and I just need to give the
number of players, that is n. And obtain the random numberical values generated by program, then we save it to the xls files.

The files include
    - *nplayers.m* (Saved in a excel)
    - *results.m*(Generate the numberical and Test for excel)
    - *upgrade1.m* (The method to generate the Matrix)

    - *players.m*(Core)
    - *playernot.m*(Core, not random)

3. The third is that the graph is built automatically, including the subsidy, machine number and taxation.

The files include

    *test.m*    (Used for plotting players)
    *test_1.m*    (Used for plotting players_1)
    *figure1.m* (Used for C1.m)
    *figure2.m*(Used for testing. Machine_number.m)

4. The fourth is to prove the numerical relationship between S_1,...,S_i,...,S_n.

The files include

    *Cal_S0.m*(Calculate the S_0 when subsidy is 0)
    *Si_Sj.m* (Validate the relationship)



The core files include *players.m* **
